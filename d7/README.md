All D7 related modules and themes are in this directory.

### How to run a make file

1. Build a Drupal site at "example/" including Drupal core and any projects defined in the makefile:
   _drush make example.make example_

2. Build a tarball of the platform above as "example.tar.gz":
   _drush make --tar example.make example_

3. Build an installation profile within an existing Drupal site:
   _drush make --no-core --contrib-destination=. installprofile.make_

### How to include a module / theme

```php
projects[entity][type] = module
projects[entity][subdir] = contrib
projects[entity][version] = 1.x-dev
```

If git is used to get the module/theme/profile add this section as well

```php
projects[entity][download][type] = git
projects[entity][download][url] = http://git.drupal.org/project/entity.git
projects[entity][download][branch] = 7.x-1.x
```
