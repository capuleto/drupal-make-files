### Welcome

This is the GitHub page for the repo. It's work in progress (WIP) but I will
alter the design and some other aspects of it real soon.

What's comming? Well I think I will link some resources about Drupal make files
and eventually installation profiles as well.

## Using phrozn to create a the page

This site is not generated by the awesome jekyll static page generator, but
Phrozn instead. [Phrozn](http://phrozn.info) is a PHP (5.3.x) copy cat, that
reuses a lot of great components of the Symfony 2 and Zend 1 frameworks. 

Please go check it out!
